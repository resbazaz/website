The Research Bazaar is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. Throughout 2025, events are happening at university campuses around the globe.

ResBaz Arizona is a free intensive conference happening **Tursday, May 29th 2024** where researchers come together to up-skill in "next generation digital research tools and skills." In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!

Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels, from ALL disciplines, from ALL institutions and organizations, as well as solo researchers. PhD and research master's students are especially encouraged to attend. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!

## Unconference

### What is an Unconference?

An unconference is a collaborative model where the attendees themselves propose and organize sessions or discussions based on their shared interests and knowledge. Rather than a pre-planned schedule, the agenda emerges organically during the event, allowing for dynamic and engaging conversations.

- **Speed Geeking:** Quickly learn and teach about diverse topics through rapid conversations with knowledgeable individuals. This fast-paced format allows you to explore a wide range of subjects in a short period.

- **Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions:** Join or lead informal discussion groups centered around specific research interests, digital tools, or areas of expertise. These sessions foster organic conversations and networking opportunities among like-minded attendees.

- **Lightning Talks:** Attend or present quick, five-minute presentations showcasing a variety of projects, research findings, or insights on digital tools. Lightning talks offer a rapid-fire way to expose yourself to numerous ideas and topics.

The Unconference Day is all about participation, collaboration, and sharing knowledge. Attendees can propose and lead sessions, contribute to discussions, or simply engage as active learners. The schedule will be dynamic, allowing you to join sessions that pique your curiosity and align with your interests.
