We're a community of current / former / aspirational researchers, data scientists, and friends helping each other to learn new technologies via various different events.

This is a diagram of who is involved in our weekly meetups, and who has has put in the work to organize our bigger festival events.

TODO:

- Click nodes to learn more!
  - Highlight clicked nodes, show selected event / github profile links
- Add a bounding box force, use space more effectively
- Prettier links, fonts

```{ojs}
import { nodeLinkDiagram } from './components/nodeLinkDiagram.ojs';

nodeLinkDiagram();
