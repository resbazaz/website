# Arizona Research Bazaar website

### Technologies used:

- [Quarto](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

### 1\. [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

### 2\. Clone this Repository

(TODO: need to update this if/when the repo moves!)

```
git clone https://github.com/resbazaz/website-draft
# TODO: switch to this once the website is ready:
# git clone https://github.com/resbazaz/website.git
```

### 3\. TODO

(probably need python, r, etc setup... might be optional?)

### 4. Previewing changes

This should build the website on your machine, serve it locally, and open a browser window to see any changes as you make them:

```
cd website
quarto preview
```

## How to contribute

### Saving and pushing changes

TODO: basic git fork + commit + PR flow

### Editing page contents

TODO: where to find markdown

### Updating page elements

TODO: where to find HTML, how includes and \_data work

### Customizing styles

TODO: Alpine, Tailwind stuff

### Changing how Github builds and deploys the site

TODO: document `.github/workflows/build.yml`

Be advised that `localData/people.json` in your local respository is just an example file, that will be overwritten by the latest ResBazAZ teams on Githubâ€”so to update who is shown, and what teams are shown, you should edit the Github teams, not the JSON file.

### Reconfiguring the site's infrastructure

TODO: document `_quarto.yml`
