### Who we are:
We are a group of people with diverse backgrounds and expertise who come together to do research. 
We are students, post-docs, faculty, researchers, and more. 

### What we do:
We work in fields like science, humanities, health, and engineering. We use technology (e.g. programming) to further our data analysis and inquiry.
We range in levels of proficiency, from beginner to expert. 

### Why are we at ResBaz?:
When researchers from different fields collaborate, incredible things can happen! Everyone has something valuable to contribute, and we all have things to learn. ResBazAZ is more than a help desk, its a community of enthusiastic researchers.


### What makes our project special and exciting?
Our goal is to expand collaborations beyond a departmental level. Thanks to our community, researchers from entirely different backgrounds become aquaintace and learn from eachother! 

* We have linguists helping engineers with MatLab.
* We have population geneticists working with software developers to create new software. 
* We have data scientists working with astronomers to create pipelines for data analysis. 
* We have machine learning engineers helping biologists analyze evolutionary patterns in mosquitoes 
* We have astronomers helping scholars in digital humanities learn Python for text analysis 

Overall, we strive to represent every background and every skill! So please join us!
